-elements/ is where you keep your custom elements.
-images/ is for static images.
-scripts/ is the place for JS scripts.
-styles/ houses your app’s shared styles and CSS rules.
-test/ is where you define tests for your web components.
-docs/ contains optional “recipes” (how-to guides) for adding features to your application or for using optional tools or editors.
