      // necessary), or kick off any processes the element wants to perform.

      // into a document.

      // This is a good place to perform any work related to your element's
      // visual state or active behavior (measuring sizes, beginning animations,
      // loading resources, etc).

      // The analog to `attached`, `detached` fires when the element has been
      // removed from a document.

      // Use this to clean up anything you did in `attached`.
